# Dogs-vs-Cats-Image-Classification-using-SVM
This project classifies images of Cats and Dogs using Machine Learning (Support Vector Machine)
I built an image classification model using Support Vector Machine (SVM) to distinguish between Cats and Dogs.

🔹 Preprocessed images (grayscale, resizing, flattening)
🔹 Trained SVM on 1600 images
🔹 Achieved ~73% accuracy
🔹 Visualized results using Confusion Matrix and Prediction Distribution graphs

This project helped me understand:
✔ Image feature extraction
✔ SVM classification
✔ Model evaluation
✔ Data visualization in ML
